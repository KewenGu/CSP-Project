### CS4341 Project5
#### Author: Kewen Gu & Zhaochen Ding

In this project, we implemented a constrain satisfaction problem solver. To run the program, type in the command line/terminal window:
		> python Main.py [input file name] [output file name (optional)]

The output file locates at the current working directory, and is called "output.txt".

To test our program on the given 26 input files, run the bash script in a bash window (eg., git bash, terminal), by typing in:
		> ./csp_test.sh

The output files are located at "TestOutputs" folder.
